				<li>Team project, developed as an entry to <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/planet-workshop-9"><strong>Global Game Jam 2020</strong></a></li>
				<li>I was responsible for programming, working in a team of 9 people alongside another programmer and 7 artists</li>
				<li>Developed in Unity</li>
				<li>Made for <strong>VR</strong></li>
				<li>Programmed the mechanics and logic of the game</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The theme for Global Game Jam 2020 was <strong>"Repair"</strong>. Our take on the theme was having the player repair planets in <strong>VR</strong>, by using a different tools for different types of disaster (e.g. a raincloud to stop a fire). We also adhered to GGJ's diversifier "Eco Action" (make a game that explores and/or inspires people to learn about and take environmental action about the climate).</p>
			<p>I programmed most of the gameplay and mechanics, while the other programmer dealt with implementing VR. I made the game randomly generate planets made of tiles of different colors (biomes), with each biome spawning different random props (e.g. a ship on a water tile). The specified amount of disasters spawn on an appropriate prop (e.g. a fire on a tree). Each tool has a different behaviour in order to fix their respective disaster.</p>
