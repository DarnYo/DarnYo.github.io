			<p>Berb Hike is a puzzle game developed for GMTK Jam 2022. The theme was "Roll of the Dice", and our take was having a Sokoban style puzzler where you walk across dice faces. Each dice has different mechanics for changing their faces as you walk on them.</p>
			<p>The game won the jam, being rated in the top 100 by players, then picked in Mark Brown's shortlist of 20 games.</p>
