				<li>Team project, developed as entry to <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019"><strong>Game Maker's Toolkit 2019 Game Jam</strong></a></li>
				<li>I was responsible with programming and design, working alongside an artist</li>
				<li>Developed in Unity</li>
				<li>Designed and developed an unique concept to match the jam theme <strong>"only one"</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our take on the theme started from Mark's suggestion when he announced it, of having only one sprite. Expanding that concept into the mechanics led us to Clone Cleanup: enemies not only use the same sprite, but the exact same abilities as you. Before heading into one of several levels, the player is presented with a choice of all unlocked upgrades thus far, followed by fighting clones using the same upgrades that were equipped. Winning a level unlocks yet more upgrades to play around with. I'm proud of the unique concept we came up with, which creates a lot of design space and interesting choices for the player. You may not want to equip a powerful upgrade as it will be used against them, and intentionally equipping debuffs is a good option.</p>
			<p>The concept posed a few technical challenges. Each upgrade has their script, with a different activation script for the player and enemies. The double jump, for instance, is triggered by input on the player end and may randomly happen in mid-air for the enemies. The AI is simple, but effective, with basic movement and random use of the equipped upgrades.</p>
