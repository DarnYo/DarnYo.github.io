			</ul>
			<p>A game of conveyors was developed as part of my coursework on Computer Science for Games. The task was to create one 3d modelled asset using <strong>3ds Max</strong>, animate it, and import it into <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> to create a puzzle prototype.</p>
			<p>For my asset, I modelled a conveyor belt. The asset is actually made of separate segments, allowing the middle segment to be tiled in order to have any length of conveyor belt. The animation is done by moving the belt slightly, then teleporting it back into the starting place, creating the illusion of continuous movement.</p>
			<p>In Unreal, the conveyor is put together using a construction script, which allows me to change the length via editor. The puzzles are built around having crates be pushed around by the conveyors and around changing the movement direction of the conveyors with a button press.</p>
